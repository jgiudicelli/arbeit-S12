{"name":"Arbeit-s12","body":"### Arbeit Project - 2012 Version\r\nThis is the 2012 version of the Arbeit project using Rails 3. It was originally conceived as an excuse to play around with the awesome Chronic gem and requires this gem to run. It is currently being used to demonstrate some mulit-model forms as well as use of jQuery. It is a work in progress and additional features will be added over the next few weeks or so.\r\n\r\nIt does have its own populate file, so after migrating the database, you can simply run ‘rake db:populate’ to add fake (but somewhat realistic) data.\r\n\r\n### Getting the code\r\nThis project should be cloned using git (yes, you could get the zip file that github graciously provides, but don't -- it's easy so learn to clone projects using git). \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/profh/arbeit-S12.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have already cloned the project and need to get an update, simply do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_local_directory/arbeit-S12/\r\n$ git pull origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis sample project was created by Professor Heimann (@profh) for 67-272 students at Carnegie Mellon University in the Spring of 2012.  Others are welcome to use the code for instructional purposes if it is helpful.","tagline":"The 2012 version of the Arbeit project demo'd in class","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
